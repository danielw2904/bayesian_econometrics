# Binomial Distribution

```{r}
size <- 100

p_grid <- seq(0,1,length.out=size)

prior <- rep(1,size)
prior2 <- ifelse(p_grid<0.5, 0, 1)
prior3 <- exp(-5*(abs(p_grid-0.5)))

successes <- 6
sample_size <- 9

likelihood <- dbinom(x = successes, size = sample_size, prob = p_grid)

unstandardized_posterior <- likelihood*prior

unstandardized_posterior2 <- likelihood*prior2

unstandardized_posterior3 <- likelihood*prior3

posterior <- unstandardized_posterior/sum(unstandardized_posterior)
posterior2 <- unstandardized_posterior2/sum(unstandardized_posterior2)
posterior3 <- unstandardized_posterior3/sum(unstandardized_posterior3)

p_grid[posterior == max(posterior)]

plot(x = p_grid, y = posterior, type = "b")

plot(x = p_grid, y = posterior2, type = "b", main = "Prior 2")

plot(x = p_grid, y = posterior3, type = "b", main = "Prior 3")
